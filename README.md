# logitall
logitall goes through your entire codebase adding console.log() statements methods and functions to provide debugging info.

logitall logs it all. This utility has been specifically created for cases where you're trying to debug JavaScript/Typescript and the source mapping breaks and you can no longer debug thigns in Visual Studio code.

That I am even writing this tool should be a reflection upon the current state of debugging tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.
